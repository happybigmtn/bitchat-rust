## Current Project Status

### Code Health
- **Compilation**: ✅ All tests and library compile successfully
- **Warnings**: 39 remaining (down from 47)
- **Architecture**: Clean modular design maintained
- **Security**: Strong cryptographic implementations

### Mobile Platforms
- **Android**: Implementation complete, ready for testing
- **iOS**: Design complete, awaiting implementation
- **Week 1 Validation**: PASSED - Both platforms viable

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 2)
1. Begin physical device testing on Android
2. Start iOS SwiftUI implementation
3. Implement battery optimization detection
4. Add service restart mechanisms

### Short-term
1. Resolve remaining 39 compiler warnings
2. Complete missing test implementations
3. Begin cross-platform interoperability testing
4. Set up physical device test lab

### Medium-term
1. Security audit preparation
2. Performance optimization
3. Multi-game framework development
4. Gateway node implementation

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **FnMut over Fn**: Changed retry policy to use FnMut for mutable closure captures
2. **Conditional Compilation**: Made benchmark module feature-gated to avoid criterion in normal builds
3. **Dependency Strategy**: Added all necessary dependencies upfront to ensure stable build

## Known Issues

### Android
- btleplug library has limited BLE peripheral mode support
- Battery optimization may kill service on some devices
- Device fragmentation across manufacturers

### iOS
- Background BLE has severe restrictions
- Local name not advertised in background
- Service UUID filtering required

### Codebase
- 39 compiler warnings remaining
- Some test implementations incomplete
- TODO implementations in integration tests
