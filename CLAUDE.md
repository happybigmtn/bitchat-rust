# BitCraps Development Memory

## Session: 2025-08-22

### Project Context
- **Repository**: BitCraps - Decentralized Craps Casino Protocol
- **Language**: Rust
- **Current Branch**: master
- **Status**: Clean working directory

### Project Overview
A peer-to-peer Bluetooth mesh casino protocol with CRAP tokens, implementing:
- Bluetooth mesh networking for offline P2P gaming
- Noise Protocol encryption with forward secrecy
- Proof-of-Relay mining system
- Decentralized craps gaming with cryptographic fairness
- CRAP token economy

### Architecture
- `protocol/`: Wire protocol & message types
- `transport/`: Bluetooth & networking layer
- `mesh/`: Mesh routing & game sessions
- `session/`: Noise protocol & encryption
- `gaming/`: Craps game logic (consolidated into protocol)
- `token/`: CRAP token ledger
- `ui/`: CLI & TUI interfaces

### Recent Commits
- e4b3619: Complete BitCraps implementation with Week 7-8 and critical security fixes
- a681917: Add Week 6 testing infrastructure
- 1ebbbe1: Consolidate gaming module into protocol module

### Session Goals
- ✅ Perform comprehensive code review
- ✅ Fix all critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Improve performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Refactor large files for maintainability

### Session Notes

#### Security Fixes Applied (2025-08-22)
Successfully fixed all 10 issues identified in code review:

**Critical (2):**
- Implemented signature verification in event log
- Added dice value validation in binary deserialization

**High Priority (4):**
- Completed forward secrecy key rotation with zeroize
- Fixed unsafe pointer operations in platform code
- Implemented bounded LRU message cache
- Fixed message queue lock contention with crossbeam

**Medium Priority (4):**
- Improved anti-cheat with token bucket rate limiting
- Replaced custom PBKDF2 with established library
- Added connection limits to prevent DoS
- Refactored large files into focused modules

All fixes have been tested and the project builds successfully.
