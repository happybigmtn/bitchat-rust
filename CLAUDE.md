- Git Status: Clean working tree  
- Task: `/predict-issues` analysis identified 10 critical issues
- User requested fixes, automated scripts caused problems (272 errors), had to revert
- Current State: 45 compilation errors → 23 errors (48% reduction)

### Session Accomplishments:

#### Fixed Multiple Critical Compilation Issues ✅
- **transport/security.rs**: Fixed undefined `data` variable (used `message_data`)
- **consensus_coordinator.rs**: Fixed incorrect method calls and struct field usage
  - Fixed `new_with_payload` → `new` for ConsensusMessage
  - Fixed non-existent `ConsensusPayload::LeaderElection` variant
  - Fixed `GameProposal` struct usage (operations→operation, removed invalid fields)
  - Added missing imports: `DiceRoll`, `Signature`
- **CheatType variants**: Fixed non-existent enum variants
  - `InvalidDiceRoll` → `InvalidRoll`
  - `StateManipulation` → `InvalidStateTransition`  
  - `Other` → `ConsensusViolation`
- **GameProposal structure**: Fixed to match actual struct definition

#### Avoided Automated Script Damage ✅
- Reverted automated refactoring that caused 272 compilation errors
- Took targeted manual approach instead of bulk automated changes
- Preserved existing working code while fixing actual issues

#### Progress Summary
- **Before**: 45 compilation errors
- **After**: 23 compilation errors  
- **Reduction**: 48% improvement (22 errors fixed)
- **Approach**: Manual, targeted fixes vs automated bulk changes

### Issues Remaining
1. Missing method implementations (poll_consensus_message, propose, etc.)  
2. Ambiguous type references needing disambiguation
3. Field access errors for non-existent struct fields
4. Array initialization methods (`[u8; 32]::new()`)

### Lessons Learned
- **Avoid aggressive automated refactoring**: The fix_critical_panics.py and reduce_clones.py scripts caused more problems than they solved
- **Manual targeted approach**: Much more effective for complex compilation errors
- **Test frequently**: Check compilation status after each logical group of changes
- **Preserve working code**: Don't modify files that compile successfully

### Next Steps
- Continue manual fixes for remaining 23 errors
- Focus on missing method implementations  
- Add proper error handling without introducing new compilation issues
- Verify fixes don't break existing working code
