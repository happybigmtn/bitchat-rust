# BitCraps Learning Assessment Framework

## Overview

This assessment framework validates understanding of the BitCraps distributed gaming system. It includes theoretical questions, practical exercises, and project challenges designed to test comprehension at multiple levels.

## Assessment Levels

### Level 1: Foundation (Chapters 1-25)
**Goal**: Understand basic distributed systems concepts and BitCraps architecture

### Level 2: Implementation (Chapters 26-50)
**Goal**: Implement core components and understand system interactions

### Level 3: Advanced (Chapters 51-75)
**Goal**: Master complex topics like consensus, security, and optimization

### Level 4: Expert (Chapters 76-100)
**Goal**: Design extensions and solve production-level challenges

## Level 1 Assessment: Foundations

### Knowledge Check Questions

1. **Transport Layer (Chapter 3)**
   - Q: Why does BitCraps use Bluetooth as its primary transport?
   - A: For local mesh networking without internet dependency, enabling offline play

2. **Peer Identity (Chapter 4)**
   - Q: How does proof-of-work identity prevent Sybil attacks?
   - A: Makes creating multiple identities computationally expensive

3. **Basic Consensus (Chapter 7)**
   - Q: What is the Byzantine fault tolerance threshold in BitCraps?
   - A: 33% - the system can tolerate up to 1/3 malicious nodes

### Practical Exercise 1: Build a Simple Peer
```rust
// Complete this code to create a basic peer
use bitcraps::protocol::PeerId;
use bitcraps::transport::MockTransport;

fn create_peer() -> Result<Peer> {
    // TODO: Generate identity
    // TODO: Create transport
    // TODO: Initialize peer
}
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Peer generates valid Ed25519 identity
- Transport initializes without errors
- Can send and receive messages

---

## Level 2 Assessment: Implementation

### Knowledge Check Questions

1. **Message Routing (Chapter 28)**
   - Q: How does TTL prevent infinite message loops?
   - A: Each hop decrements TTL; messages are dropped when TTL reaches 0

2. **State Management (Chapter 32)**
   - Q: What's the purpose of vector clocks in state synchronization?
   - A: Track causality and detect concurrent updates for conflict resolution

3. **Anti-Cheat (Chapter 37)**
   - Q: Name three types of cheating BitCraps detects
   - A: Time manipulation, statistical anomalies, over-betting

### Practical Exercise 2: Implement Consensus
```rust
// Implement a simple voting mechanism
struct SimpleConsensus {
    proposals: HashMap<ProposalId, Proposal>,
    votes: HashMap<ProposalId, Vec<Vote>>,
}

impl SimpleConsensus {
    fn create_proposal(&mut self, data: Vec<u8>) -> ProposalId {
        // TODO: Create proposal
    }
    
    fn vote(&mut self, id: ProposalId, approve: bool) -> Result<()> {
        // TODO: Record vote
    }
    
    fn has_consensus(&self, id: ProposalId) -> bool {
        // TODO: Check if 2/3+ majority reached
    }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Correctly counts votes
- Enforces 2/3 majority threshold
- Prevents double voting

### Project Challenge 2: Build a Mini Mesh Network
Create a working mesh network with 5 nodes that can:
- Discover peers
- Route messages with TTL
- Handle node failures
- Maintain routing tables

---

## Level 3 Assessment: Advanced Topics

### Knowledge Check Questions

1. **Byzantine Consensus (Chapter 56)**
   - Q: Explain the three phases of PBFT consensus
   - A: Pre-prepare (proposal), Prepare (initial agreement), Commit (final agreement)

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Chapter 63)**
   - Q: How do commit-reveal schemes ensure fairness?
   - A: Players commit to values before revealing, preventing manipulation based on others' choices

3. **Performance Optimization (Chapter 71)**
   - Q: What's the benefit of lock-free data structures?
   - A: Avoid thread contention and improve concurrent performance

### Practical Exercise 3: Implement Anti-Cheat Detection
```rust
// Build statistical anomaly detector
struct AnomalyDetector {
    history: Vec<DiceRoll>,
    threshold: f64,
}

impl AnomalyDetector {
    fn add_roll(&mut self, roll: DiceRoll) {
        // TODO: Add to history
    }
    
    fn detect_bias(&self) -> bool {
        // TODO: Run chi-square test
        // TODO: Compare against threshold
    }
    
    fn calculate_entropy(&self) -> f64 {
        // TODO: Calculate Shannon entropy
    }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Correctly implements chi-square test
- Detects biased dice with 95% confidence
- Handles edge cases (small sample sizes)

### Project Challenge 3: Production-Ready Component
Choose one component and make it production-ready:
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement monitoring and metrics
- Write extensive tests
- Document all edge cases
- Add performance benchmarks

## Level 4 Assessment: Expert Challenges

### Knowledge Check Questions

1. **System Architecture (Chapter 85)**
   - Q: Design a sharding strategy for 10,000+ concurrent games
   - A: Consider consistent hashing, range-based sharding, or geographic distribution

2. **Security Model (Chapter 92)**
   - Q: How would you extend BitCraps to support zero-knowledge game verification?
   - A: Implement zk-SNARKs for game state transitions, allowing verification without revealing moves

3. **Scalability (Chapter 98)**
   - Q: Propose a layer-2 scaling solution for BitCraps
   - A: State channels for frequent players, with on-mesh settlement for disputes

### Practical Exercise 4: Extend the System
Choose one extension to implement:

1. **Multi-Game Framework**
   ```rust
   trait GameEngine {
       type State;
       type Action;
       type Result;
       
       fn initialize() -> Self::State;
       fn validate_action(state: &Self::State, action: Self::Action) -> bool;
       fn apply_action(state: Self::State, action: Self::Action) -> Self::Result;
   }
   
   // TODO: Implement for Blackjack
   // TODO: Implement for Poker
   // TODO: Create game registry
   ```

2. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
   ```rust
   // Replace current crypto with post-quantum algorithms
   trait QuantumResistant {
       fn generate_keypair() -> (PublicKey, PrivateKey);
       fn sign(message: &[u8], key: &PrivateKey) -> Signature;
       fn verify(message: &[u8], sig: &Signature, key: &PublicKey) -> bool;
   }
   
   // TODO: Implement using lattice-based crypto
   // TODO: Ensure backward compatibility
   ```

3. **Cross-Chain Bridge**
   ```rust
   // Bridge BitCraps with blockchain networks
   trait BlockchainBridge {
       async fn lock_tokens(amount: u64) -> TxHash;
       async fn mint_crap_tokens(proof: TxHash) -> CrapTokens;
       async fn burn_crap_tokens(amount: CrapTokens) -> BurnReceipt;
