2. **Auto-Scaling Engine (Ch. 121)**: Claims 734 lines, completely missing
3. **Advanced Operations Module**: Claims comprehensive automation, only stubs exist
4. **SDK Implementation**: Claims full SDK, only architectural placeholders

### Category: Wrong File References
1. **Config Module (Ch. 2)**: References app_config.rs instead of config/mod.rs
2. **Anti-Cheat (Ch. 24)**: References protocol/anti_cheat.rs, actual: mesh/anti_cheat.rs
3. **Game Logic (Ch. 27)**: References protocol/game_logic.rs, actual: gaming/craps_rules.rs

## High Priority Issues

### Category: Major Line Count Discrepancies
- **Error Module**: Claims 145 lines, actual 161 lines
- **App State**: Claims 400+ lines, actual 548 lines
- **Protocol Module**: Claims 749 lines, actual 1,135 lines
- **Byzantine Consensus**: Claims 600+ lines, actual ~100 lines
- **Anti-Cheat**: Claims 750+ lines, actual 133 lines

### Category: Missing Critical Features
1. **Consensus System**: Walkthroughs describe complete PBFT, actual is basic stub
2. **Security Hardening**: Claims 1,283 lines of advanced security, mostly missing
3. **System Monitoring**: Claims 1,147 lines, actual ~50 lines basic metrics
4. **Memory Pool Management**: Claims NUMA-aware allocators, not implemented

### Category: Overstated Production Readiness
- Most walkthroughs claim 9.0-9.8/10 production readiness
- Actual implementation: 3-6/10 for most advanced features
- Core gaming: ~60% production ready
- Advanced operations: ~20% production ready

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### Category: Architecture Misrepresentation
1. **Library Architecture**: Missing 6+ modules (contracts, economics, treasury, etc.)
2. **Gaming Framework**: Simpler than documented, missing claimed features
3. **Mobile Platform**: TODOs and placeholders throughout
4. **Platform Module**: 22 lines actual vs detailed trait system documented

### Category: Missing Implementations
1. **Async Database Pool**: Not documented but exists
2. **Multi-tier Cache**: Implemented but not fully integrated
3. **PostgreSQL Backend**: Exists but not documented
4. **Transport Encryption**: More advanced than documented

### Category: API Changes
1. **Bet Type Conversion**: Uses BetType::to_u8() instead of hardcoded mapping
2. **Command Executor**: Internal methods evolved from documentation
3. **Network Bridge**: Different features than described

---

## Low Priority Issues

### Category: Minor Discrepancies
1. **SIMD Claims**: Overstates SIMD usage (mostly uses Rayon parallelism)
2. **Base Point Representation**: Minor differences in X25519 constants
3. **Schema Fields**: Additional tracking fields not documented
4. **Test Coverage**: Some test implementations differ

### Category: Educational vs Reality
- Walkthroughs provide excellent CS education
- Implementation details sometimes simplified or idealized
- Some theoretical optimizations not actually implemented

---

## Implementation Fixes Required

### Codebase Issues Found During Review

1. **TODO Implementations**:
   - Mobile mesh service initialization (mobile/mod.rs:394-398)
   - Bluetooth adapter discovery returns mock data (mobile/mod.rs:421)
   - Various platform-specific implementations incomplete

2. **Missing Error Handling**:
   - Some unwrap() calls in production code paths
   - Incomplete error propagation in some modules

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Some claimed optimizations not implemented
   - Lock-free structures missing where documented

---

## Walkthrough Updates Required

### Files Requiring Complete Rewrite
1. **02_config_module_walkthrough.md** - Wrong file, wrong system
2. **124_lockfree_data_structures_walkthrough.md** - No implementation exists
3. **121_auto_scaling_walkthrough.md** - Feature doesn't exist

### Files Needing Major Updates (50%+ changes)
1. All walkthroughs with duplicate chapter numbers
2. **14_byzantine_consensus_walkthrough.md** - Basic stub vs claimed implementation
3. **24_anti_cheat_system_walkthrough.md** - 133 lines vs 750+ claimed
4. **46_platform_module_walkthrough.md** - 22 lines vs detailed implementation
5. **120_system_monitoring_walkthrough.md** - Basic metrics vs comprehensive system
6. **122_security_hardening_walkthrough.md** - Basic operations vs advanced features

### Files Needing Minor Updates (accuracy generally good)
1. **08_crypto_encryption_walkthrough.md** - 85% accurate
2. **10_crypto_random_walkthrough.md** - 95% accurate  
3. **11_crypto_secure_keystore_walkthrough.md** - 90% accurate
4. **29_transport_layer_walkthrough.md** - 95% accurate
5. **30_mesh_networking_walkthrough.md** - 94% accurate
6. **56_tui_casino_walkthrough.md** - 95% accurate
7. **59_reputation_system_walkthrough.md** - 95% accurate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix all duplicate chapter numbers
2. Mark fabricated features as "Future Implementation"
3. Update all line counts to match reality
4. Add implementation status indicators to each walkthrough

### Documentation Standards
1. Create automated validation to check walkthrough accuracy
2. Add "Implementation Status" section to each walkthrough
3. Separate "Current Implementation" from "Future Plans"
4. Regular quarterly reviews to maintain accuracy

### Code Improvements
1. Complete TODO implementations in mobile module
2. Implement missing SDK components
3. Complete operations automation features
4. Add missing lock-free data structures if needed

## Summary

The Feynman walkthroughs demonstrate excellent pedagogical structure and CS foundations but suffer from significant accuracy issues. Approximately 35% of content describes features that don't exist or are severely overstated. The walkthroughs should be updated to reflect actual implementation status while maintaining their educational value.
