# Chapter 90: BLE Peripheral Mode

## Introduction

This chapter explores BLE Peripheral Mode in the context of distributed systems, covering Advertisement, GATT services, characteristic design.

## The Fundamentals

Understanding BLE Peripheral Mode requires knowledge of:
- Advertisement
-  GATT services
-  characteristic design

## Deep Dive: Implementation

```rust
// Core implementation details for BLE Peripheral Mode
pub struct Implementation {
    // Details specific to this topic
}
```

## Production Considerations

When deploying BLE Peripheral Mode in production:
1. Performance implications
2. Security considerations
3. Monitoring requirements
4. Failure modes

## Testing Strategies

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_implementation() {
        // Test cases for BLE Peripheral Mode
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

BLE Peripheral Mode is essential for building robust distributed systems. The key principles covered here provide the foundation for production implementations.

Key takeaways:
1. Advertisement
1.  GATT services
1.  characteristic design

Remember: Understanding BLE Peripheral Mode deeply enables building more resilient and efficient systems.
