# Chapter 76: Consensus Voting Mechanisms

## Introduction: Democracy in Distributed Systems

Imagine trying to get a group of strangers scattered across the world to agree on something, where some might be lying, others might disappear mid-conversation, and you can never be sure if everyone got the same message. This is the challenge of voting in distributed consensus systems.

## The Fundamentals: Voting Theory

Distributed voting must handle:
- Byzantine voters (malicious participants)
- Network partitions during voting
- Vote manipulation and replay attacks
- Sybil attacks (fake identities)
- Ensuring finality of decisions

## Deep Dive: Weighted Voting Systems

### Stake-Based Voting Weight

```rust
pub struct WeightedVoting {
    /// Voter weights based on stake
    weights: HashMap<NodeId, VoteWeight>,
    
    /// Current voting round
    round: VotingRound,
    
    /// Vote aggregator
    aggregator: VoteAggregator,
}

pub struct VoteWeight {
    stake: u64,
    reputation: f64,
    age_multiplier: f64,
}

impl WeightedVoting {
    pub fn calculate_weight(&self, voter: &NodeId) -> u64 {
        let weight = self.weights.get(voter).unwrap();
        let base_weight = weight.stake;
        let reputation_factor = weight.reputation;
        let age_factor = weight.age_multiplier;
        
        (base_weight as f64 * reputation_factor * age_factor) as u64
    }
    
    pub fn tally_votes(&self, votes: &[Vote]) -> VotingResult {
        let mut tally: HashMap<Choice, u64> = HashMap::new();
        
        for vote in votes {
            if self.verify_vote(vote).is_ok() {
                let weight = self.calculate_weight(&vote.voter);
                *tally.entry(vote.choice.clone()).or_insert(0) += weight;
            }
        }
        
        let total_weight: u64 = tally.values().sum();
        let threshold = (total_weight * 2) / 3; // 2/3 majority
        
        for (choice, weight) in tally {
            if weight > threshold {
                return VotingResult::Decided(choice);
            }
        }
        
        VotingResult::NoConsensus
    }
}
```

## Commit-Reveal Voting

### Preventing Vote Manipulation

```rust
pub struct CommitRevealVoting {
    /// Commitment phase
    commitments: HashMap<NodeId, VoteCommitment>,
    
    /// Reveal phase
    reveals: HashMap<NodeId, RevealedVote>,
    
    /// Timing control
    phase_timing: PhaseTimer,
}

pub struct VoteCommitment {
    hash: Hash256,
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    signature: Signature,
}

impl CommitRevealVoting {
    pub async fn commit_vote(&mut self, vote: &SecretVote) -> Result<()> {
        // Create commitment
        let nonce = generate_random_nonce();
        let commitment_data = [vote.choice.as_bytes(), &nonce].concat();
        let hash = blake3::hash(&commitment_data);
        
        let commitment = VoteCommitment {
            hash: hash.into(),
            timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
            signature: self.sign(&hash),
        };
        
        // Store commitment
        self.commitments.insert(vote.voter, commitment);
        
        // Broadcast commitment
        self.broadcast_commitment(&commitment).await
    }
    
    pub async fn reveal_vote(&mut self, vote: &SecretVote, nonce: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
        // Verify commitment exists
        let commitment = self.commitments.get(&vote.voter)
            .ok_or(Error::NoCommitment)?;
        
        // Verify hash matches
        let commitment_data = [vote.choice.as_bytes(), nonce].concat();
        let hash = blake3::hash(&commitment_data);
        
        if hash.as_bytes() != &commitment.hash.0 {
            return Err(Error::InvalidReveal);
        }
        
        // Store reveal
        self.reveals.insert(vote.voter, RevealedVote {
            choice: vote.choice.clone(),
            nonce: nonce.to_vec(),
            revealed_at: SystemTime::now(),
        });
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Quorum Formation

### Dynamic Quorum Calculation

```rust
pub struct QuorumCalculator {
    /// Minimum quorum size
    min_quorum: usize,
    
    /// Byzantine fault tolerance
    byzantine_threshold: f64,
    
    /// Network size estimator
    size_estimator: NetworkSizeEstimator,
}

impl QuorumCalculator {
    pub fn calculate_quorum(&self, active_nodes: usize) -> QuorumRequirements {
        // Byzantine fault tolerance: need > 2/3 for safety
        let byzantine_quorum = (active_nodes * 2 / 3) + 1;
        
        // Ensure minimum participation
        let required = byzantine_quorum.max(self.min_quorum);
        
        QuorumRequirements {
            minimum: required,
            optimal: (active_nodes * 3 / 4) + 1,
            timeout: self.calculate_timeout(active_nodes),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn has_quorum(&self, votes: usize, total: usize) -> bool {
        let requirements = self.calculate_quorum(total);
        votes >= requirements.minimum
    }
}
```

## Testing Voting Mechanisms

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_byzantine_voting() {
        let mut voting = WeightedVoting::new();
        
        // Add honest voters (70% stake)
        for i in 0..7 {
            voting.add_voter(node_id(i), 100);
        }
        
        // Add byzantine voters (30% stake)
        for i in 7..10 {
            voting.add_voter(node_id(i), 100);
        }
        
        // Honest votes
        let mut votes = vec![];
        for i in 0..7 {
            votes.push(Vote::new(node_id(i), Choice::A));
        }
        
        // Byzantine votes
        for i in 7..10 {
            votes.push(Vote::new(node_id(i), Choice::B));
        }
        
        // Should decide on Choice::A (70% > 66.7% threshold)
        assert_eq!(voting.tally_votes(&votes), VotingResult::Decided(Choice::A));
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Voting mechanisms are the foundation of democratic consensus in distributed systems. Through weighted voting, commit-reveal schemes, and proper quorum calculation, we can achieve Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement.

Key takeaways:
1. **Weighted voting** accounts for stake and reputation
2. **Commit-reveal** prevents vote manipulation
3. **Quorum requirements** ensure Byzantine fault tolerance
4. **Phase timing** coordinates voting rounds
5. **Vote verification** prevents replay attacks

Remember: In distributed voting, the challenge isn't counting votesâ€”it's ensuring that every vote counted can be trusted.
