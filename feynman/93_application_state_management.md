# Chapter 93: Application State Management

## Introduction

This chapter explores Application State Management in the context of distributed systems, covering Global state, state machines, event handling.

## The Fundamentals

Understanding Application State Management requires knowledge of:
- Global state
-  state machines
-  event handling

## Deep Dive: Implementation

```rust
// Core implementation details for Application State Management
pub struct Implementation {
    // Details specific to this topic
}
```

## Production Considerations

When deploying Application State Management in production:
1. Performance implications
2. Security considerations
3. Monitoring requirements
4. Failure modes

## Testing Strategies

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_implementation() {
        // Test cases for Application State Management
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Application State Management is essential for building robust distributed systems. The key principles covered here provide the foundation for production implementations.

Key takeaways:
1. Global state
1.  state machines
1.  event handling

Remember: Understanding Application State Management deeply enables building more resilient and efficient systems.
