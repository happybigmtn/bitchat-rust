# BitCraps Technical Walkthroughs

## Overview

This folder contains the technical walkthroughs used for the semester curriculum and broader deep‑dives. To avoid confusion from historical duplication and numbering drift, we now use a single canonical course plan and keep a separate raw inventory.

## Start Here

- Semester plan (canonical order): `feynman/walkthroughs/00_SEMESTER_PLAN.md`
- Foundational chapters (0A–0E): in this folder
- Full inventory (all chapters): `feynman/walkthroughs/00_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md`

## Format

Walkthroughs follow the Feynman prompt template in `feynman/project_docs/prompt.md` and include:
- Implementation Status block
- Computer Science foundations and math derivations
- Advanced Rust patterns (lifetimes, ownership, async, zero‑copy)
- Senior engineering review and concrete improvement recommendations
- Lab exercise and “check yourself” questions

## Notes

- Historical duplication remains under `feynman/walkthroughs/feynman/walkthroughs/`. The semester plan resolves ordering and topic duplication without renaming the entire archive mid‑course.
- If you add or update chapters, update the Semester Plan and the raw Table of Contents accordingly.
