## Introduction

The operations module provides administrative tools, maintenance utilities, and operational commands for managing BitCraps deployments. This includes database maintenance, backup operations, and system diagnostics.

## Implementation

### Operation Commands

```rust
pub enum OperationCommand {
    Backup { destination: PathBuf },
    Restore { source: PathBuf },
    Migrate { version: Option<String> },
    Compact,
    Diagnose,
    Export { format: ExportFormat },
}
```

### Maintenance Tasks

```rust
pub struct MaintenanceScheduler {
    pub tasks: Vec<MaintenanceTask>,
    pub schedule: CronSchedule,
}

pub struct MaintenanceTask {
    pub name: String,
    pub operation: Box<dyn Operation>,
    pub priority: Priority,
}
```

### Diagnostics

```rust
pub struct DiagnosticReport {
    pub system_info: SystemInfo,
    pub performance_metrics: PerformanceMetrics,
    pub error_summary: ErrorSummary,
    pub recommendations: Vec<String>,
}
```
