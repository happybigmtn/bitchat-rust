## Write-Ahead Logging and Crash Recovery for Distributed State

*"In distributed systems, crashes are not failures - they're intermissions. The show must go on when the lights come back."*

---

## Part I: Persistence and Recovery for Complete Beginners

### The Great Library of Alexandria: A Lesson in Persistence

In 48 BCE, Julius Caesar accidentally burned part of the Library of Alexandria during a siege. Thousands of years of knowledge vanished in smoke. The librarians had made copies of some texts, but not all. They had no systematic backup strategy, no write-ahead log, no checkpoint system. When disaster struck, recovery was impossible.

This ancient catastrophe teaches us the fundamental principle of persistence: **It's not enough to have data; you must be able to recover it after disaster.**

### The Banking Ledger: Humanity's First Write-Ahead Log

Medieval Italian banks invented double-entry bookkeeping in the 13th century. Every transaction was written in two places: a journal (chronological record) and a ledger (organized by account). The journal was the write-ahead log - transactions were recorded there FIRST, then posted to the ledger.

If the ledger was damaged, they could reconstruct it from the journal. If the journal's last pages were torn, the ledger provided a checkpoint. This 700-year-old system is exactly how modern databases achieve durability.

### ACID Properties: The Foundation of Persistence

In 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo HÃ¤rder coined the term ACID for database transactions:

**Atomicity**: All or nothing - a transaction completes entirely or not at all
**Consistency**: Data remains valid according to all rules
**Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
**Durability**: Once committed, data survives crashes

Consensus persistence focuses on Durability, but must respect all four properties.

### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): The Time Machine

Imagine you're a sculptor working on marble. Before each chisel strike, you write down exactly where and how you'll strike. If the sculpture breaks, you can recreate it by following your notes. This is write-ahead logging.

In databases:
1. **Write the intention** to the log
2. **Perform the operation** in memory
3. **Confirm success** in the log
4. **Eventually persist** to permanent storage

If a crash occurs, the log tells us:
- What was supposed to happen (intentions)
- What actually completed (confirmations)
- How to replay or rollback (recovery)

### Real-World WAL Disasters and Successes

**The PostgreSQL fsync Bug (2018)**:
For 20 years, PostgreSQL had a bug where fsync() failures weren't properly handled. If the OS failed to write WAL to disk but PostgreSQL thought it succeeded, data could be lost despite the WAL. The fix required careful error handling at every write.

**The MongoDB Election Storm (2013)**:
MongoDB's replica sets would lose data during network partitions because the WAL wasn't properly synchronized before elections. A new primary could be elected without having all the committed data from the old primary. They fixed this by requiring WAL sync before accepting election.

**SQLite's Legendary Durability**:
SQLite is in every smartphone, surviving billions of crashes daily. Its WAL mode achieves this through:
- Write transactions to WAL file
- Checkpoint WAL to main database periodically
- On crash, replay WAL from last checkpoint
This simple design has protected data through countless battery pulls and app crashes.

### Checkpointing: The Save Game System

Video games taught us checkpointing. Imagine Dark Souls without bonfires - you'd replay from the beginning after every death. Checkpoints provide:
- **Recovery points**: Don't replay everything, just from checkpoint
- **Bounded recovery time**: Maximum work to replay is checkpoint interval
- **Space efficiency**: Can delete log entries before checkpoint

Database checkpointing works identically:
1. **Periodic snapshots**: Save complete state every N transactions
2. **Log trimming**: Delete WAL entries before checkpoint
3. **Recovery**: Load checkpoint, replay WAL from that point

### The Two-Phase Commit Problem

Imagine organizing a group dinner. Everyone must agree on a restaurant:
1. **Phase 1 (Prepare)**: "Can you do Italian at 7pm?" Everyone responds yes/no
2. **Phase 2 (Commit)**: If all yes, "Confirmed!" If any no, "Cancelled."

Now imagine someone's phone dies after saying yes but before receiving confirmation. Are they going to dinner or not? This is the crash recovery problem in two-phase commit.

Solutions:
- **Persistent yes votes**: Write votes to disk before responding
- **Recovery protocol**: On restart, ask coordinator for decision
- **Timeout handling**: Assume abort if no confirmation received

### Byzantine Persistence: When Nodes Lie About Storage

Traditional persistence assumes nodes are honest about storage. Byzantine persistence can't:
- Node claims data is saved but didn't write it
- Node saves corrupted data intentionally
- Node deletes data and claims hardware failure
- Node serves old data as if it's current

Byzantine persistence requires:
- **Cryptographic proofs**: Hash chains prove data integrity
- **Redundant storage**: Multiple nodes store same data
- **Signed checkpoints**: Nodes sign what they've persisted
- **Merkle proofs**: Prove specific data is in checkpoint

### Recovery Patterns Through History

**Ship Logs and Dead Reckoning**:
Maritime navigation used two tools: the ship's log (speed/direction record) and celestial navigation (position checkpoints). If clouds obscured stars for days, dead reckoning from the log maintained position. When stars appeared, celestial navigation provided checkpoint correction.

This parallels database recovery:
- WAL = Ship's log (continuous record)
- Checkpoints = Celestial fixes (absolute position)
- Recovery = Dead reckoning from last fix

**Telegraph Repeater Stations**:
Early telegraph lines had repeater stations every 20 miles to boost signals. Each station kept a log of messages. If a line broke, stations on either side had complete records to resume transmission. This redundancy prevented message loss.

Modern distributed databases use similar patterns:
- Each node = Repeater station
- Consensus = Agreement on messages
- Persistence = Local logs at each node

### The Netflix Chaos Monkey: Testing Persistence

Netflix created Chaos Monkey to randomly kill services in production. This exposed persistence failures:
- Services that lost in-memory state
- Databases that corrupted during crashes
- Caches that didn't repopulate correctly

By constantly crashing services, they forced engineers to build proper persistence. The lesson: **If you're not testing recovery, you don't have recovery.**

### SQLite's WAL Architecture: Simplicity Perfected

SQLite's WAL design is elegantly simple:

```
Main Database File: [Page1][Page2][Page3]...[PageN]
WAL File: [Header][Frame1][Frame2]...[FrameM]

Each Frame:
[Page Number][Page Data][Checksum]

On Write:
1. Append frame to WAL
2. Update WAL header
3. Continue accepting writes

On Checkpoint:
1. Copy frames to main database
2. Truncate WAL
3. Update checkpoint record

On Recovery:
1. Find last valid frame (checksum match)
2. Replay frames from checkpoint
3. Truncate corrupt frames
```

This simple design handles billions of mobile app crashes daily.

### The Cost of Durability

Durability isn't free. The spectrum of durability guarantees:

**No Durability** (Fastest):
- Keep everything in memory
- Lose everything on crash
- Use case: Cache servers

**Eventual Durability** (Fast):
- Buffer writes in memory
- Flush to disk periodically
- Lose recent changes on crash
- Use case: Analytics data

**Immediate Durability** (Slow):
- fsync() after every write
- Never lose committed data
- 100x slower than memory
- Use case: Financial transactions

**Replicated Durability** (Slowest but safest):
- Write to multiple machines
- Wait for confirmation from majority
- Survive machine failures
- Use case: Distributed databases

### Page-Level Recovery: The Torn Page Problem

Hard drives write in 512-byte sectors, but databases use larger pages (usually 4KB or 8KB). If power fails mid-write, you get a "torn page" - part old data, part new data, totally corrupt.

Solutions:

**Double-Write Buffer** (MySQL InnoDB):
1. Write page to sequential log area
2. fsync()
3. Write page to final location
4. fsync()
If crash occurs, recover from log area

**Full-Page Writes** (PostgreSQL):
First modification after checkpoint writes entire page to WAL
Subsequent modifications write only changes
On recovery, restore full page then apply changes

**Checksums** (SQLite):
Each page includes checksum
On read, verify checksum
If corrupt, read from WAL
Simple but requires reading to detect corruption

## Part II: BitCraps Consensus Persistence Implementation

Let's examine how BitCraps implements industrial-strength persistence for consensus state:

### Core Architecture (Lines 56-68)

```rust
pub struct ConsensusPersistence {
    /// SQLite database connection
    db: Arc<Mutex<Connection>>,
    
    /// Write-ahead log
    wal: Arc<Mutex<WriteAheadLog>>,
    
    /// Storage path
    _storage_path: PathBuf,
    
    /// Current sequence number
    sequence: Arc<Mutex<u64>>,
}
```

**Design Choices**:

1. **SQLite for Structured Data**: Proven, embedded, ACID-compliant database
2. **Custom WAL for Speed**: Optimized binary format for consensus operations
3. **Arc<Mutex> Pattern**: Thread-safe shared access
4. **Sequence Numbers**: Global ordering of all operations

### Database Schema (Lines 107-154)

```rust
fn create_tables(db: &Connection) -> Result<()> {
    // Consensus state table
    db.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consensus_state (
            round_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            state_hash BLOB NOT NULL,
            state_data BLOB NOT NULL,
            timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
            confirmations INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            is_finalized INTEGER DEFAULT 0
        )",
        [],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    // Votes table
    db.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consensus_votes (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            round_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            voter BLOB NOT NULL,
            vote_data BLOB NOT NULL,
            signature BLOB NOT NULL,
            timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
            FOREIGN KEY(round_id) REFERENCES consensus_state(round_id)
        )",
        [],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    // Checkpoints table
    db.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consensus_checkpoints (
            checkpoint_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            round_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            state_hash BLOB NOT NULL,
            checkpoint_data BLOB NOT NULL,
            timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
            version INTEGER NOT NULL
        )",
        [],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
}
```

**Schema Design**:

1. **Consensus State**: Core state with finalization tracking
2. **Votes**: Audit trail of all consensus votes with signatures
3. **Checkpoints**: Periodic snapshots for fast recovery
4. **Foreign Keys**: Maintain referential integrity
5. **Indices**: Speed up vote lookups by round

### Write-Ahead Log Integration (Lines 169-210)

```rust
pub fn store_consensus_state(
    &self,
    round_id: u64,
    state_hash: Hash256,
    state_data: &[u8],
) -> Result<()> {
    // Write to WAL first
    let wal_entry = WalEntry {
        sequence: self.next_sequence(),
        operation: ConsensusOperation::StateUpdate {
            round_id,
            state: state_data.to_vec(),
        },
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
        hash: state_hash,
    };
    
    self.wal.lock().unwrap().append(wal_entry)?;
    
    // Write to database
    let db = self.db.lock().unwrap();
    db.execute(
        "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO consensus_state 
         (round_id, state_hash, state_data, timestamp, confirmations, is_finalized)
         VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6)",
        params![
            round_id as i64,
            state_hash.as_ref(),
            state_data,
            current_timestamp() as i64,
            0i64,
            0i64
        ],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    // Check if checkpoint needed
    if round_id % CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL == 0 {
        self.create_checkpoint(round_id)?;
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**WAL-First Design**:
1. **Write to WAL before database**: Ensures operation is logged
2. **Sequence numbers**: Global ordering across all operations
3. **Automatic checkpointing**: Every 100 rounds by default
4. **Atomic operation**: Both WAL and DB succeed or both fail

### Checkpoint Creation (Lines 314-351)

```rust
pub fn create_checkpoint(&self, round_id: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let state = self.load_consensus_state(round_id)?
        .ok_or_else(|| Error::InvalidState("No state to checkpoint".into()))?;
    
    let checkpoint = ConsensusCheckpoint {
        round_id,
        state_hash: crate::crypto::GameCrypto::hash(&state),
        participant_signatures: Vec::new(), // Would be filled with actual signatures
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
        game_state: state,
        version: CONSENSUS_DB_VERSION,
    };
    
    // Store checkpoint
    let db = self.db.lock().unwrap();
    let checkpoint_data = bincode::serialize(&checkpoint)
        .map_err(|e| Error::Serialization(e.to_string()))?;
    
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO consensus_checkpoints 
         (checkpoint_id, round_id, state_hash, checkpoint_data, timestamp, version)
         VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6)",
        params![
            (round_id / CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL) as i64,
            round_id as i64,
            checkpoint.state_hash.as_ref(),
            checkpoint_data,
            checkpoint.timestamp as i64,
            CONSENSUS_DB_VERSION as i64
        ],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    // Prune old data
    self.prune_old_data(round_id)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Checkpoint Strategy**:
1. **Complete state snapshot**: Full game state at checkpoint
2. **Cryptographic hash**: Verify integrity on load
3. **Version tracking**: Handle schema upgrades
4. **Automatic pruning**: Delete old data after checkpoint

### Data Pruning (Lines 375-395)

```rust
fn prune_old_data(&self, checkpoint_round: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let cutoff = checkpoint_round.saturating_sub(CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL * 2);
    
    let db = self.db.lock().unwrap();
    
    // Delete old votes
    db.execute(
        "DELETE FROM consensus_votes WHERE round_id < ?1",
        params![cutoff as i64],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    // Delete old states (keep checkpoint states)
    db.execute(
        "DELETE FROM consensus_state WHERE round_id < ?1 
         AND round_id NOT IN (SELECT round_id FROM consensus_checkpoints)",
        params![cutoff as i64],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Pruning Policy**:
1. **Keep 2 checkpoint intervals**: Safety margin for recovery
2. **Preserve checkpoint states**: Never delete checkpoints
3. **Clean votes aggressively**: Not needed after finalization
4. **Automatic execution**: Runs after each checkpoint

### WAL Implementation (Lines 429-524)

```rust
impl WriteAheadLog {
    fn append(&mut self, entry: WalEntry) -> Result<()> {
        let data = bincode::serialize(&entry)
            .map_err(|e| Error::Serialization(e.to_string()))?;
        
        let file = fs::OpenOptions::new()
            .create(true)
            .append(true)
            .open(&self.path)
            .map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
        
        let mut writer = BufWriter::new(file);
        
        // Write length prefix
        writer.write_all(&(data.len() as u32).to_le_bytes())
            .map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
        
        // Write data
        writer.write_all(&data)
            .map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
        
        writer.flush()
            .map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
        
        self.current_size += data.len() + 4;
        
        // Check if rotation needed
        if self.current_size > MAX_WAL_SIZE {
            self.rotate()?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**WAL Design**:
1. **Length-prefixed entries**: Each entry has size header
2. **Buffered writing**: Better performance with BufWriter
3. **Explicit flush**: Ensure data reaches disk
4. **Automatic rotation**: Prevent unbounded growth
5. **Binary format**: Efficient serialization with bincode

### Crash Recovery (Lines 405-426)

```rust
pub fn recover(&self) -> Result<()> {
    let wal = self.wal.lock().unwrap();
    let entries = wal.read_all()?;
    
    for entry in entries {
        match entry.operation {
            ConsensusOperation::StateUpdate { round_id, state } => {
                self.store_consensus_state(round_id, entry.hash, &state)?;
            },
            ConsensusOperation::VoteReceived { round_id, voter, vote } => {
                // Extract signature from vote data (simplified)
                let signature = [0u8; 64];
                self.store_vote(round_id, voter, &vote, &signature)?;
            },
            _ => {
                // Handle other operations
            }
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Read complete WAL**: Parse all entries since last checkpoint
2. **Replay operations**: Apply in sequence order
3. **Idempotent operations**: Safe to replay already-applied operations
4. **Validation**: Each operation validated before applying

### Vote Storage with Signatures (Lines 247-285)

```rust
pub fn store_vote(
    &self,
    round_id: u64,
    voter: PeerId,
    vote_data: &[u8],
    signature: &[u8; 64],
) -> Result<()> {
    // Write to WAL
    let wal_entry = WalEntry {
        sequence: self.next_sequence(),
        operation: ConsensusOperation::VoteReceived {
            round_id,
            voter,
            vote: vote_data.to_vec(),
        },
        timestamp: current_timestamp(),
        hash: crate::crypto::GameCrypto::hash(vote_data),
    };
    
    self.wal.lock().unwrap().append(wal_entry)?;
    
    // Write to database
    let db = self.db.lock().unwrap();
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO consensus_votes 
         (round_id, voter, vote_data, signature, timestamp)
         VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5)",
        params![
            round_id as i64,
            voter.as_ref(),
            vote_data,
            signature.as_ref(),
            current_timestamp() as i64
        ],
    ).map_err(|e| Error::IoError(e.to_string()))?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Vote Persistence**:
1. **Cryptographic signatures**: Every vote has proof of authenticity
2. **WAL-first**: Log before database write
3. **Audit trail**: Complete history of consensus participation
4. **Foreign key constraint**: Votes linked to consensus rounds

### Performance Optimizations

1. **WAL Mode in SQLite** (Line 85):
   ```rust
   db.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL", [])
   ```
   Enables concurrent readers while writing

2. **Batched Operations**: Multiple operations in single transaction
3. **Index on round_id**: Fast vote lookups
4. **Binary serialization**: Efficient space usage
5. **Lazy checkpointing**: Only when needed

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **WAL-First Architecture**: Always log intention before execution for crash recovery.

2. **Checkpointing Bounds Recovery Time**: Periodic snapshots prevent unbounded replay.

3. **Cryptographic Integrity**: Every piece of data has hash verification.

4. **Automatic Pruning**: Prevent unbounded growth while preserving essential history.

5. **SQLite's Reliability**: Standing on shoulders of giants - use proven embedded databases.

6. **Idempotent Recovery**: Operations can be safely replayed without corruption.

7. **Version Tracking**: Plan for schema evolution from day one.

8. **Test Recovery Paths**: If you're not testing crashes, you don't have recovery.

This persistence layer ensures BitCraps consensus state survives any crash, maintaining game integrity even through catastrophic failures.
