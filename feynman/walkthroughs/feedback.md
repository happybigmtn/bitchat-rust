2. **Add Prometheus Metrics Integration** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```rust
   // Add actual metrics endpoint implementation
   async fn metrics_handler(State(state): State<GatewayState>) -> impl IntoResponse {
       // Include histogram buckets, per-route-method tracking
   }
   ```

3. **Update WebSocket Handling** (Priority: HIGH)

   ```rust
   // Show runtime role change handling
   async fn transition_role(
       from: NodeRole,
       to: NodeRole,
       config: &mut AppConfig
   ) -> Result<()>
   ```

2. **Expand Integration Examples** (Priority: MEDIUM)

   - Include client SDK role-aware behavior

3. **Add Resource Management** (Priority: LOW)
   - Show role-based resource allocation
   - Include memory/CPU limits by role
   - Add monitoring by role type

## Priority Implementation Plan

### Critical Updates (Must Fix - Score < 8)

**Target: Chapter 118 (Gateway)**
1. Replace entire implementation section with current Axum patterns
2. Add complete Prometheus metrics code
3. Fix WebSocket subscriber tracking
4. Update broker abstraction

### High Priority Updates (Should Fix - Score 8-9)

**Target: Chapter 17 (Byzantine Consensus)**
1. Update method signatures to match actual code
2. Add view change implementation details
3. Include performance benchmarks

**Target: Chapter 141 (Validator Roles)**  
1. Add dynamic role transition examples
2. Expand integration patterns

### Low Priority Enhancements (Nice to Have - Score 9+)

**All High-Scoring Walkthroughs**
1. Add distributed tracing examples
2. Include more performance metrics
3. Expand real-world scenarios

## Common Patterns to Standardize

### 1. Code Example Format
```rust
// Always include file reference
// File: src/services/api_gateway/gateway.rs:123-145
pub async fn actual_implementation() -> Result<()> {
    // Use actual code from codebase
}
```

### 2. Performance Data Format
```yaml
Benchmark Results:
  Validators: 10
  Throughput: 50,000 ops/sec
  P50 Latency: 45ms
  P95 Latency: 120ms
  P99 Latency: 250ms
```

### 3. Integration Example Format
```mermaid
graph LR
    Client --> Gateway
    Gateway --> Validator
    Validator --> ConsensusEngine
    ConsensusEngine --> GameEngine
```

## Quality Metrics Target

After implementing these improvements:
- **Target Average Score**: 9.5/10 (from current 8.9/10)
- **No walkthroughs below**: 9.0/10
- **All code examples**: 100% match with actual implementation
- **All production patterns**: Documented with metrics

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Fix Chapter 118 (Gateway) - Critical
2. **Week 2**: Update Chapter 17 (Byzantine) and 141 (Roles)
3. **Week 3**: Add minor enhancements to 9+ scored walkthroughs

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All code examples compile and match actual implementation
- [ ] All walkthroughs include performance benchmarks
- [ ] Integration patterns documented with diagrams
