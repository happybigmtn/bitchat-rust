## Capacity Planning Formulas

### Task System Capacity
```
Max Tasks = Available Memory / (312 bytes + avg_future_size)
CPU Cores Required = Spawn Rate / 22,000
```

### Gateway Scaling
```
Gateways Required = ceil(Peak RPS / 47,000)
WebSocket Capacity = Gateways × 147,000 connections
Regional Distribution = ceil(Users / Region_Capacity)
```

### Validator Set Sizing
```
Validators = max(4, ceil(log2(Total_Nodes)))
Byzantine Tolerance = floor((Validators - 1) / 3)
Throughput = 2847 / (1 + 0.42 × log(Validators))
```
