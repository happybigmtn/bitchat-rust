# Chapter 49: Alerting System Walkthrough

## Introduction

The alerting system provides multi-channel notifications with severity levels, escalation policies, and intelligent deduplication. This ensures critical issues are promptly addressed while preventing alert fatigue.

## Implementation

### Alert Management

```rust
pub struct AlertingSystem {
    pub rules: Vec<AlertRule>,
    pub channels: Vec<Box<dyn NotificationChannel>>,
    pub deduplicator: AlertDeduplicator,
    pub escalation: EscalationManager,
}

pub struct Alert {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub severity: AlertSeverity,
    pub title: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub labels: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
}
```

### Severity Levels

```rust
pub enum AlertSeverity {
    Critical,  // Immediate action required
    High,      // Urgent issue
    Medium,    // Needs attention
    Low,       // Informational
}
```

### Notification Channels

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait NotificationChannel {
    async fn send(&self, alert: &Alert) -> Result<()>;
    fn supports_severity(&self, severity: AlertSeverity) -> bool;
}

pub struct SlackChannel { webhook_url: String }
pub struct EmailChannel { smtp_config: SmtpConfig }
pub struct PagerDutyChannel { api_key: String }
```
