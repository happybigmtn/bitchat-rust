## A Primer on Input Validation: From SQL Injection to Zero-Days

On November 2, 1988, the Morris Worm brought the internet to its knees. It exploited a buffer overflow in the finger daemon - a program that didn't validate input length. By sending more data than expected, the worm overwrote memory, injected code, and took control. This wasn't the first buffer overflow, but it was the first to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of trusting user input. Thirty-five years later, input validation failures remain the root cause of most security vulnerabilities. OWASP's Top 10 consistently lists injection attacks at the top. The lesson is clear: never trust input, always validate.

Input validation is deceptively simple in concept - check that input matches expectations before processing it. But implementation is fiendishly complex. What constitutes valid input? How do you handle edge cases? What about unicode, null bytes, or nested encodings? Bobby Tables ('); DROP TABLE Students;--) became a meme because it's funny, but SQL injection is deadly serious. In 2017, Equifax was breached through an unvalidated input field, exposing 147 million people's data.

The principle of least privilege applies to input validation - accept only what's necessary, reject everything else. Whitelisting (accepting known good) is safer than blacklisting (rejecting known bad). But whitelisting is harder - you must enumerate all valid cases. Blacklisting is easier but dangerous - attackers find patterns you didn't think of. The Unicode consortium adds new characters yearly. Each could bypass your filters.

Defense in depth means validating at every layer. Client-side validation improves UX but provides no security - attackers bypass browsers. Server-side validation is essential but insufficient - internal services might have vulnerabilities. Database validation catches what application validation misses. Each layer should validate independently, assuming others might fail.

Type confusion vulnerabilities arise when validation doesn't match processing. JavaScript's loose typing is notorious - "2" + 2 equals "22" but "2" - 2 equals 0. PHP's type juggling caused countless vulnerabilities - "0e123" == "0e456" is true because both parse as zero in scientific notation. Strong typing helps but isn't sufficient - even strongly typed languages have parsing ambiguities.

Rate limiting is a form of input validation - validating the rate of input, not just content. Without rate limiting, attackers can brute force passwords, overwhelm services, or extract data through timing attacks. But rate limiting is complex - legitimate users might trigger limits, distributed attacks bypass per-IP limits, and business logic might require different rates for different operations.

The token bucket algorithm elegantly implements rate limiting. Each user gets a bucket holding tokens. Requests consume tokens. Tokens refill at a constant rate. When the bucket is empty, requests are rejected. This allows bursts (full bucket) while preventing sustained abuse (refill rate). Variations include leaky bucket (constant output rate) and sliding window (counts requests in time window).

Sanitization differs from validation - validation rejects bad input, sanitization cleans it. HTML sanitization removes dangerous tags. SQL parameterization escapes special characters. But sanitization is dangerous - it's easy to miss cases. The XSS filter in Internet Explorer was itself vulnerable to XSS. When possible, reject rather than sanitize.

Regular expressions are powerful but dangerous for validation. ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) occurs when regex complexity grows exponentially with input length. The pattern (a+)+ takes exponential time on strings like "aaaaaaaaaaX". Regex engines backtrack, trying all possible matches. Careful regex design and timeouts prevent ReDoS.

Path traversal (../) attacks exploit insufficient file path validation. Attackers escape intended directories, accessing sensitive files. But paths are complex - Windows uses backslash, URLs use forward slash, UNC paths start with \\. Symbolic links, hard links, and junction points complicate validation. Canonicalization - converting to absolute paths - helps but isn't foolproof.

Integer overflow in validation causes vulnerabilities. Checking if (size > MAX_SIZE) fails if size overflows to negative. Checking if (offset + size > buffer_length) fails if offset + size overflows. Safe integer libraries, compiler warnings, and explicit overflow checks prevent these bugs.

Unicode and encoding attacks bypass naive validation. UTF-8 allows multiple encodings of the same character. Percent encoding (%2E%2E%2F is ../) hides attacks. Null bytes (%00) terminate strings in C but not in other languages. Normalization, canonicalization, and consistent encoding prevent these attacks.

Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) races affect validation. You validate input, then process it. Between validation and processing, input might change. File systems are particularly vulnerable - check file permissions, file changes, access fails. Atomic operations, locks, and re-validation prevent TOCTOU.

Injection attacks extend beyond SQL. Command injection (system("ping " + user_input)), LDAP injection, XPath injection, Header injection, and Log injection all exploit insufficient validation. Each context has special characters that need escaping. Parameterized queries, prepared statements, and context-aware encoding prevent injection.

Machine learning models need input validation too. Adversarial inputs - slightly modified images that fool classifiers - are essentially validation failures. Models trained on unconstrained input can be poisoned. Input constraints, outlier detection, and adversarial training improve model robustness.

The future of input validation involves formal methods and AI assistance. Property-based testing automatically finds inputs that violate specifications. Fuzzing with coverage guidance finds edge cases. Static analysis identifies validation gaps. But human judgment remains essential - determining what constitutes valid input requires understanding business logic.

## The BitCraps Input Validation Implementation

Now let's examine how BitCraps implements comprehensive input validation with defense in depth, rate limiting, and sanitization to prevent attacks.

```rust
//! Input validation framework for production safety
//! 
//! Provides comprehensive validation for all external inputs to prevent:
//! - Buffer overflows
//! - SQL injection
//! - Integer overflows
//! - Malformed data attacks
//! - DoS through resource exhaustion
```

This header lists specific threats, not generic "security". Buffer overflows, SQL injection, integer overflows - each requires different validation strategies. DoS through resource exhaustion acknowledges that validation itself can be attacked.

```rust
/// Validation rules for different input types
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ValidationRules {
    pub max_packet_size: usize,
    pub max_string_length: usize,
    pub max_array_length: usize,
    pub max_bet_amount: u64,
    pub min_bet_amount: u64,
    pub max_players_per_game: usize,
    pub max_games_per_player: usize,
    pub max_message_rate: u32,
    pub rate_limit_window: Duration,
    pub require_signatures: bool,
    pub allow_anonymous: bool,
}
```

Comprehensive validation rules cover multiple dimensions. Size limits prevent memory exhaustion. Bet limits prevent economic attacks. Player limits prevent resource abuse. Rate limits prevent spam. Signature requirements prevent spoofing. Each rule targets specific attack vectors.

```rust
/// Input validator with rate limiting
pub struct InputValidator {
    rules: ValidationRules,
    rate_limiter: Arc<RateLimiter>,
    sanitizer: Arc<InputSanitizer>,
}
```

Separation of concerns - validation, rate limiting, and sanitization are independent but coordinated. Arc enables sharing between threads. This architecture allows different components to evolve independently.

Rate limiting implementation:

```rust
/// Token bucket for rate limiting
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct TokenBucket {
    tokens: f64,
    last_refill: Instant,
    max_tokens: f64,
    refill_rate: f64,
}

/// Check if request is allowed and consume tokens
pub async fn check_and_consume(&self, peer: PeerId, tokens: f64) -> Result<bool> {
    let mut buckets = self.buckets.write().await;
    
    let bucket = buckets.entry(peer).or_insert_with(|| {
        TokenBucket {
            tokens: self.max_requests as f64,
            last_refill: Instant::now(),
            max_tokens: self.max_requests as f64,
            refill_rate: self.max_requests as f64 / self.window.as_secs_f64(),
        }
    });
    
    // Refill tokens based on elapsed time
    let now = Instant::now();
    let elapsed = now.duration_since(bucket.last_refill).as_secs_f64();
    bucket.tokens = (bucket.tokens + elapsed * bucket.refill_rate).min(bucket.max_tokens);
    bucket.last_refill = now;
    
    // Check if we have enough tokens
    if bucket.tokens >= tokens {
        bucket.tokens -= tokens;
        Ok(true)
    } else {
        Ok(false)
    }
}
```

Token bucket algorithm provides flexible rate limiting. Tokens refill continuously, not in chunks. Bursts are allowed up to bucket capacity. Float tokens allow fractional consumption. Per-peer buckets prevent one user affecting others. This implementation handles both steady traffic and bursts gracefully.

Packet validation:

```rust
/// Validate a packet
pub async fn validate_packet(&self, data: &[u8], sender: PeerId) -> Result<()> {
    // Check rate limit
    if !self.rate_limiter.check_and_consume(sender, 1.0).await? {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError("Rate limit exceeded".to_string()));
    }
    
    // Check packet size
    if data.len() > self.rules.max_packet_size {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError(format!(
            "Packet size {} exceeds maximum {}",
            data.len(),
            self.rules.max_packet_size
        )));
    }
    
    // Check for malformed data
    if data.is_empty() {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError("Empty packet".to_string()));
    }
    
    // Check packet structure (basic validation)
    if data.len() < 4 {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError("Packet too small".to_string()));
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

Layered validation with fail-fast approach. Rate limit first (cheapest check). Size check next (prevent memory exhaustion). Empty check (common error). Structure check (protocol compliance). Each check fails fast with specific error. Order matters - expensive checks last.

Bet validation with economic constraints:

```rust
/// Validate a bet
pub fn validate_bet(&self, amount: u64, player_balance: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Check bet limits
    if amount < self.rules.min_bet_amount {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError(format!(
            "Bet {} below minimum {}",
            amount,
            self.rules.min_bet_amount
        )));
    }
    
    if amount > self.rules.max_bet_amount {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError(format!(
            "Bet {} exceeds maximum {}",
            amount,
            self.rules.max_bet_amount
        )));
    }
    
    // Check player balance
    if amount > player_balance {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError(format!(
            "Bet {} exceeds balance {}",
            amount,
            player_balance
        )));
    }
    
    // Check for integer overflow
    if amount == u64::MAX {
        return Err(Error::ValidationError("Invalid bet amount".to_string()));
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

Financial validation prevents economic attacks. Minimum prevents dust attacks. Maximum prevents overflow. Balance check prevents debt. u64::MAX check prevents special value exploitation. These checks maintain economic invariants.

Input sanitization:

```rust
impl InputSanitizer {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // Compile dangerous patterns
        let patterns = vec![
            regex::Regex::new(r"<script.*?>.*?</script>").unwrap(), // XSS
            regex::Regex::new(r"javascript:").unwrap(), // JS injection
            regex::Regex::new(r"on\w+\s*=").unwrap(), // Event handlers
            regex::Regex::new(r"[';]--").unwrap(), // SQL comments
            regex::Regex::new(r"union\s+select").unwrap(), // SQL injection
            regex::Regex::new(r"exec\s*\(").unwrap(), // Code execution
            regex::Regex::new(r"eval\s*\(").unwrap(), // Eval
            regex::Regex::new(r"\.\./").unwrap(), // Path traversal
            regex::Regex::new(r"\\x[0-9a-f]{2}").unwrap(), // Hex encoding
        ];
```

Pattern-based sanitization for known attacks. Each pattern targets specific vulnerability class. Compiled once for efficiency. Patterns are conservative - better to over-sanitize than under-sanitize. This blacklist approach complements whitelist validation.

Binary data validation:

```rust
/// Sanitize binary data
pub fn sanitize_bytes(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    // Check for common attack patterns in binary
    if data.len() > 4 {
        // Check for zip bombs (high compression ratio)
        if data[0..4] == [0x50, 0x4B, 0x03, 0x04] {
            // ZIP file header
            return Err(Error::ValidationError("Compressed data not allowed".to_string()));
        }
        
        // Check for executable headers
        if data[0..2] == [0x4D, 0x5A] { // MZ header
            return Err(Error::ValidationError("Executable files not allowed".to_string()));
        }
        
        if data[0..4] == [0x7F, 0x45, 0x4C, 0x46] { // ELF header
            return Err(Error::ValidationError("Executable files not allowed".to_string()));
        }
    }
    
    Ok(data.to_vec())
}
```

Magic byte detection prevents file-based attacks. ZIP detection prevents compression bombs. Executable detection prevents code injection. These checks happen early, before parsing. Simple byte comparisons are fast and reliable.

## Key Lessons from Input Validation Security

This implementation embodies several crucial validation principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers catch different attacks.

2. **Fail Fast**: Check cheap validations before expensive ones.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through temporal validation.

4. **Type Safety**: Use appropriate types to prevent confusion.

5. **Specific Errors**: Detailed errors aid debugging without leaking info.

6. **Sanitization Fallback**: Clean input when rejection isn't possible.

7. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect known attack signatures.

The implementation demonstrates important patterns:

- **Token Bucket**: Flexible rate limiting with burst allowance
- **Magic Bytes**: Detect file types by headers
- **Regex Compilation**: Pre-compile patterns for performance
- **Layered Checks**: Order validations by cost
- **Economic Validation**: Maintain financial invariants

This input validation framework transforms BitCraps from a trusting system to a skeptical one, validating every input at multiple layers to prevent the vast majority of security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
