# Walkthrough Review — Round 3 (Post-Fix Validation)

- Scope: All walkthroughs in `feynman/walkthroughs/*_walkthrough.md`
- Validator: Link + code path + status + heuristic line-count checks

## Results
- Files reviewed: 213
- Files with issues: 0
- Missing Implementation Status: 0
- Missing code paths: 0
- Broken internal links: 0
- Line count mismatches: 0

## Notes
- Round 2 issues (broken links and missing code paths) fixed by updating links to canonical chapters and mapping references to actual modules in `src/`.
- Foundational chapters (0A–0E) and the Semester Plan provide context and order; no mass renames beyond flattening were needed.

## Artifacts
- Detailed summary: `feynman/walkthroughs/WALKTHROUGH_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`
- Round 2 issues (pre-fix): `feynman/walkthroughs/WALKTHROUGH_ISSUES_ROUND2.md`
