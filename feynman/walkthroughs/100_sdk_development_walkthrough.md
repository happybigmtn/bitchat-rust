# Chapter 151: SDK Development Walkthrough

Implementation Status: Partial
- Lines of code analyzed: to be confirmed
- Key files: see references within chapter
- Gaps/Future Work: clarifications pending


## Introduction

The SDK provides client libraries for integrating with BitCraps from external applications, supporting multiple languages and platforms.

## Implementation

### Client SDK

```rust
pub struct BitCrapsClient {
    pub connection: Connection,
    pub auth: Authentication,
    pub game_api: GameApi,
