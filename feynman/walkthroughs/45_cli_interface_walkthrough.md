# Chapter 41: CLI Interface Walkthrough

Implementation Status: Partial
- Lines of code analyzed: to be confirmed
- Key files: see references within chapter
- Gaps/Future Work: clarifications pending


## Introduction

The CLI interface provides command-line interaction for BitCraps with subcommand routing, argument parsing, and casino operations. Built on the clap framework, it demonstrates modern CLI design patterns.

## Implementation

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "bitchat")]
pub struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    pub command: Commands,
    
    #[arg(short, long, default_value = "8080")]
    pub port: u16,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Chat,
    Connect { address: String },
    Casino,
    CreateGame { max_players: Option<usize> },
    Bet { bet_type: String, amount: u64 },
}
```

## Design Features

- Declarative CLI definition
- Type-safe argument parsing
- Hierarchical commands
- Default values

## Production Readiness: 8.0/10

Clean implementation using industry-standard clap framework.
