# BitCraps Security Hardening Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive security hardening implementation for the BitCraps decentralized casino protocol. The security improvements address critical vulnerabilities identified in the security review and implement defense-in-depth strategies.

## Security Modules Implemented

### 1. Input Validation (`src/security/input_validation.rs`)

- Entropy sources with quality assessment
- Cryptographic commitments with pattern detection
- String inputs with length and content validation
- Array lengths with configurable limits
- Network message sizes (max 64KB default)
- IP addresses with basic pattern checks

**Security Features:**
- Real-time violation counting and monitoring
- Context-aware validation with operation tracking
- Sanitization of potentially malicious inputs
- Protection against integer overflow attacks

### 2. Rate Limiting (`src/security/rate_limiting.rs`)

**Token bucket algorithm implementation with:**
- Per-IP and per-operation rate limiting

  - Game joins: 10/minute
  - Dice rolls: 30/minute  
  - Network messages: 300/minute
  - Bet placement: 60/minute

- Suspicious activity detection and escalation

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- Progressive blocking (escalating penalties)

- Entropy quality assessment
- Dice roll commit-reveal validation

**Security-Critical Functions:**
- Memory clearing with volatile operations
- Bounds checking without early termination
- Pattern detection in entropy sources
- Constant-time conditional selection

### 5. Security Event Logging (`src/security/security_events.rs`)

**Comprehensive security monitoring:**
- Structured event definitions with severity levels
- Sanitization of sensitive data in logs
- Event correlation capabilities
- Statistics and trend analysis
- Integration hooks for external monitoring systems

**Event Categories:**
- Input validation failures
- Authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- DoS attack patterns
- Cryptographic failures
- Game integrity violations
- Network security events
