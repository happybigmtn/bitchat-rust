## üèóÔ∏è Key Technical Innovations

### Bit Field Encoding
```rust
// Pack entire game state into 64-bit metadata field
metadata (64 bits):
‚îú‚îÄ Bits 0-1:    Phase (ComeOut=0, Point=1, Ended=2)  
‚îú‚îÄ Bits 2-5:    Point value (0=none, 4-10 encoded)
‚îú‚îÄ Bits 6-31:   Series ID (26 bits, up to 67M series)
‚îî‚îÄ Bits 32-63:  Roll count (32 bits, up to 4B rolls)
```

### Pre-Computed Lookup Tables
```rust
// O(1) bet resolution for all combinations
static PAYOUT_LOOKUP_TABLE: [[u32; 13]; 64] = /* pre-computed */;
let (resolution, payout) = PAYOUT_LOOKUP_TABLE[bet_type][dice_total];
```

### Copy-on-Write State Management
```rust
// Memory sharing until mutation
let state2 = state1.clone();  // Shares Arc<DynamicGameData>
state2.make_mutable();        // Triggers copy-on-write only when needed
```

### Variable-Length Integer Encoding
```rust
// Compress large numbers efficiently
VarInt::encode(127)     // ‚Üí [0x7F] (1 byte vs 8)
VarInt::encode(16384)   // ‚Üí [0x80, 0x80, 0x01] (3 bytes vs 8)
```

### Merkle Tree Consensus
```rust
// Fast proof generation and verification
let proof = tree.generate_proof(leaf_index);  // O(log n)
let valid = MerkleTree::verify_proof(root, leaf, &proof);  // O(log n)
```
