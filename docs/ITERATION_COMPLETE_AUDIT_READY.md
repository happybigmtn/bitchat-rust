## 🔍 Audit Recommendations

### Priority Areas
1. **Cryptographic Implementation**: Verify Ed25519 usage and key management
2. **Consensus Algorithm**: Validate Byzantine fault tolerance
3. **Network Protocol**: Check for race conditions and edge cases
4. **Mobile Security**: Platform-specific vulnerability assessment
5. **Random Number Generation**: Verify entropy sources

### Known Limitations
1. **BLE Mesh Scale**: Limited to ~8 concurrent connections per device
2. **iOS Background**: Limited BLE advertising in background
3. **Battery Impact**: Continuous scanning still consumes power
4. **Network Partitions**: Recovery strategies need real-world testing

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
1. Physical device testing on 10+ devices
2. Network stress testing with partitions
3. Security penetration testing
4. Performance profiling on low-end devices

### Short-term (3-4 weeks)
1. UI/UX completion for mobile apps
2. App store compliance review
3. Legal/regulatory assessment
4. Beta testing program

### Medium-term (5-8 weeks)
1. Production monitoring setup
2. SDK documentation
3. Marketing preparation
4. Launch strategy
