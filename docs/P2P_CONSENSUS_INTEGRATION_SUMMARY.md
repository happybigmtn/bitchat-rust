## Components Created

### 1. NetworkConsensusBridge (`src/protocol/network_consensus_bridge.rs`)
**Purpose**: Bridges local consensus engine to distributed network consensus
**Key Features**:
- Connects `ConsensusEngine` to `ConsensusCoordinator`
- Handles state synchronization across peers
- Manages operation timeouts and failure handling
- Compresses game state for efficient BLE transmission

### 2. ConsensusMessageHandler (`src/mesh/consensus_message_handler.rs`)
**Purpose**: Specialized message handling for consensus messages in mesh network
**Key Features**:
- Priority-based message queues (Critical, High, Normal, Low)
- Message validation and rate limiting
- Integration with mesh service events
- DoS protection and spam prevention

### 3. ConsensusGameManager (`src/gaming/consensus_game_manager.rs`)
**Purpose**: Manages game sessions with distributed consensus
**Key Features**:
- Multiplayer game creation and joining
- Distributed bet placement and dice rolling
- Game state synchronization
- Event-driven architecture for game updates

### 4. Enhanced App Integration (`src/app_state.rs`)
**Purpose**: Integrates P2P consensus components into main application
**Key Features**:
- Initialization of all consensus components
- Convenience methods for P2P game operations
- Statistics and monitoring integration

## Message Flow

### Game Creation Flow
1. `app.create_consensus_game()` called
2. `ConsensusGameManager` creates new game session
3. `NetworkConsensusBridge` created for game
4. `ConsensusCoordinator` started for network coordination
5. Game announcement broadcast to mesh network

### Bet Placement Flow
1. Player calls `app.place_consensus_bet()`
2. `ConsensusGameManager.place_bet()` creates operation
3. `NetworkConsensusBridge.submit_operation()` handles consensus
4. `ConsensusCoordinator.submit_operation()` broadcasts proposal
5. All participants vote via `ConsensusEngine.vote_on_proposal()`
6. Byzantine consensus achieved (>2/3 agreement)
7. Game state updated across all nodes

### Network Message Flow
1. Consensus message created by `ConsensusCoordinator`
2. Message converted to `BitchatPacket` by bridge
3. `MeshService.broadcast_packet()` routes to transport
4. `TransportCoordinator` sends via Bluetooth
5. Receiving nodes process via `ConsensusMessageHandler`
6. Valid messages forwarded to appropriate consensus bridge

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Mesh Service Integration
- `MeshService.set_consensus_handler()` registers message handler
- Consensus packets identified by `PACKET_TYPE_CONSENSUS_VOTE`
- Priority routing for critical consensus messages
- Message deduplication and loop prevention

### 2. Transport Layer Integration
- Automatic packet serialization/deserialization
- BLE-optimized message compression
- MTU-aware message fragmentation
- Connection management for consensus participants

### 3. Game Framework Integration
- Consensus operations map to game actions
- State synchronization with game framework
- Event system for game updates
- Statistics and monitoring integration

## Security Features

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Requires >2/3 agreement for consensus
- Cryptographic signatures on all votes
- Protection against malicious participants
- Fork detection and resolution

### Anti-Cheat Mechanisms
- Message validation and signature verification
- Timestamp verification for replay protection
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Dispute resolution system

### Randomness Generation
- Commit-reveal schemes for dice rolls
- Distributed entropy collection
- Verifiable random number generation
- Protection against manipulation

## Mobile Optimizations

### BLE Constraints
- Message compression using LZ4
- Priority queues for critical messages
- Adaptive timeouts for battery optimization
- MTU-aware packet fragmentation

### Performance
- State checkpointing for quick sync
- Lazy state loading
- Efficient serialization with bincode
- Background task optimization

let game_id = app.create_consensus_game(participants).await?;

// Other players join
app.join_consensus_game(game_id).await?;
```

// Place bet with consensus
app.place_consensus_bet(game_id, BetType::Pass, CrapTokens::new(100)).await?;

// Roll dice with distributed randomness
let dice_roll = app.roll_consensus_dice(game_id).await?;

// Get game state
let game_state = app.get_consensus_game_state(&game_id).await;
```

### Statistics and Monitoring
```rust
// Get consensus statistics
let stats = app.get_consensus_stats().await;
println!("Games created: {}", stats.total_games_created);
println!("Operations processed: {}", stats.total_operations_processed);
```
