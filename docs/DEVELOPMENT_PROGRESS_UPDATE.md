## Remaining Work

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. [ ] Create load testing framework
2. [ ] Build cross-platform UI components
3. [ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms
4. [ ] Fix test suite hanging issue

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)

2. [ ] Battery usage optimization
3. [ ] Complete UI implementation
4. [ ] Cross-platform interoperability testing

### Low Priority (Week 5-6)

4. [ ] Store submission preparation

## Technical Debt

### Issues to Address
- 166 compiler warnings (mostly unused code)
- Test suite hangs when run completely
- 761 unwrap/expect calls need proper error handling
- 613 Arc clones could be optimized

### Performance Reality Check
- **Realistic Capacity**: 10-50 concurrent users (BLE limitation)
- **Throughput**: 100-1000 ops/sec (not 10k claimed)
- **Latency**: 50-200ms typical
- **Battery**: 20-30% drain per hour (not <5% claimed)

## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ Low Risk
- Core protocol implementation
- Security architecture
- Monitoring infrastructure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk
