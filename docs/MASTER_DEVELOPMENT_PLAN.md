## 1. Critical Immediate Fixes (Week 1)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All Week 1 Goals Achieved

### üö® MUST FIX BEFORE ANY OTHER DEVELOPMENT

#### Android Critical Fixes

##### Permissions (AndroidManifest.xml)
```xml
<!-- CORRECTED: Was missing BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

<!-- Legacy for API ‚â§30 -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" 
                 android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

<!-- Foreground Service for Android 14+ -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE" />
```

##### Foreground Service Implementation
```xml
<!-- CRITICAL: Must declare service type -->
<service 
    android:name=".BluetoothMeshService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="connectedDevice"
    android:exported="false" />
```

##### JNI Thread Safety Fix
```rust
// WRONG - Thread unsafe
// pub struct AndroidEventHandler {
//     jni_env: Arc<Mutex<JNIEnv<'static>>>, // CRASHES!
// }

// CORRECT - Thread safe
pub struct AndroidEventHandler {
    jvm: JavaVM,  // Store JavaVM instead
    callback: GlobalRef,
}
```

#### iOS Critical Fixes

##### Info.plist Corrections
```xml
<!-- CORRECT: Only use current key -->
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>BitCraps uses Bluetooth to connect with nearby players.</string>

<!-- REMOVED: Deprecated, causes App Review issues -->
<!-- <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key> -->
```

##### Background BLE Reality
- ‚ùå Local name NOT advertised in background
- ‚ùå Service UUIDs move to overflow area
- ‚úÖ Must use service UUID filtering
- ‚úÖ Exchange identity after connection

#### Architecture Fixes

##### UniFFI Pattern (UDL-only)
```idl
// CORRECT: Single source of truth in .udl file
interface BitcrapsNode {
    [Throws=BitcrapsError, Async]
    void start_discovery();
    
    // NO callback interfaces - use async
    [Async]
    GameEvent? poll_event();
}
```

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| BLE Fragmentation | High | High | Extensive device testing, fallback protocols |
| App Store Rejection | High | Medium | Early review, compliance focus |
| Security Vulnerability | Critical | Low | Multiple audits, bug bounty |
| Battery Complaints | Medium | High | Aggressive optimization, user controls |
| Network Scalability | High | Low | Sharding, gateway nodes |

### Platform-Specific Risks

#### Android
- **Doze Mode**: Foreground Service helps but not immune
- **OEM Battery**: Samsung/Xiaomi aggressive optimization
- **Fragmentation**: Different BLE stacks per manufacturer
- **Play Policy**: Must justify Foreground Service usage

#### iOS
- **Background Limits**: Severe BLE restrictions
- **App Review**: Strict Bluetooth usage scrutiny
- **TestFlight**: Different behavior than production
- **State Restoration**: Complex Bluetooth restoration

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Early Validation**: Week 1 spikes before commitment
2. **Physical Testing**: Real devices, not simulators
3. **Compliance First**: Follow platform guidelines exactly
4. **User Education**: Clear battery usage expectations
5. **Fallback Options**: TCP/IP when BLE unavailable
