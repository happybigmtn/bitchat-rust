FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BitCraps Launches World's First Mathematically Provable Fair Gaming Platform

Revolutionary peer-to-peer casino eliminates house edge through cryptographic protocols and mesh networking technology

[CITY, DATE] - BitCraps, the pioneering decentralized gaming platform, today announced the public launch of the world's first mathematically provable fair casino. Unlike traditional online gambling platforms that require players to trust proprietary algorithms, BitCraps uses advanced cryptographic techniques to guarantee fairness through mathematical proof.

The platform addresses the fundamental trust problem in online gaming by eliminating central authorities entirely. Players connect directly through mesh networking technology, with game outcomes determined by cryptographically verifiable random number generation that cannot be manipulated by any party.

"Traditional online casinos ask players to trust them, but trust shouldn't be necessary when mathematics can provide certainty," said [CEO/Founder Name]. "BitCraps represents the next evolution in gaming - where fairness is guaranteed by cryptographic proof rather than corporate promises."

Key innovations include:
- Provably fair algorithms with mathematical verification
- Zero house edge through peer-to-peer competition
- Mesh networking for direct player connections
- Open source codebase for complete transparency
- Byzantine fault tolerance for security assurance

The platform launches with classic craps gameplay, with additional games planned for future releases. All game mechanics and random number generation can be independently verified by players or third-party auditors.

BitCraps is available for download on iOS and Android platforms, with web-based play launching in Q2 2024.

About BitCraps:
BitCraps is the world's first provably fair, decentralized gaming platform that eliminates trust through mathematical proof. Founded in 2024, the company is committed to transparent, fair gaming through open source development and cutting-edge cryptographic protocols.
