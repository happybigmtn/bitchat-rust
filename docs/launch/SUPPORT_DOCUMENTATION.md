## 2. Core Support Articles

### 2.1 Getting Started Guide

#### "How to Download and Install BitCraps"
**Quick Answer:** Download BitCraps from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android), then follow the setup wizard.

**Detailed Steps:**

**For iOS:**
1. Open the App Store on your iPhone or iPad
2. Search for "BitCraps" or use this direct link: [App Store Link]
3. Tap "Get" and authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your Apple ID password
4. Wait for download to complete (approximately 50MB)
5. Tap "Open" or find the BitCraps icon on your home screen
6. Follow the welcome tutorial to set up your first game

**For Android:**
1. Open Google Play Store on your Android device
2. Search for "BitCraps" in the search bar
3. Select "BitCraps - Decentralized Casino" from results
4. Tap "Install" and confirm any permissions requested
5. Launch the app once installation completes
6. Complete the initial setup and tutorial

**System Requirements:**
- iOS: iOS 14.0 or later, 100MB free space
- Android: Android 8.0 (API level 26) or later, 100MB free space
- Network: WiFi or cellular data connection required

**Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues:**
- **"App not found"**: Ensure your region supports the app or contact support
- **"Insufficient storage"**: Free up at least 200MB for installation and updates
- **"Installation failed"**: Restart device and try again, check internet connection

#### "Understanding Provably Fair Gaming"
**Quick Answer:** BitCraps uses mathematical proofs to guarantee every dice roll is fair and impossible to manipulate.

**How It Works:**
1. **Before the game**: Each player commits to a random number without revealing it
2. **During the roll**: All players reveal their numbers simultaneously
3. **Result calculation**: Numbers are combined using cryptographic functions to determine the dice result
4. **Verification**: Anyone can verify the math to confirm the roll was fair

**Visual Verification:**
- Look for the green "âœ“ Verified" checkmark after each roll
- Tap the verification icon to see the mathematical proof
- Use the "Verify Roll" feature to double-check any game result
- Access complete game history with verification for all past games

**Why This Matters:**
- Traditional online casinos can manipulate results - BitCraps mathematically cannot
- No "house edge" - you compete directly with other players
- Complete transparency - all game logic is open source and auditable
- Trust through mathematics, not corporate promises

### 2.2 Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Can't Connect to Other Players"
**Quick Answer:** Check your internet connection and ensure BitCraps has network permissions.

**Detailed Troubleshooting:**

**Step 1: Check Basic Connectivity**
- Verify internet connection works in other apps

- Move closer to WiFi router if signal is weak

**Step 2: App Permissions**
- iOS: Settings > BitCraps > Allow app to use WiFi and Cellular

**Step 3: Network Environment**
- Corporate/school networks may block peer-to-peer connections
- Try using a different network (mobile hotspot, home WiFi)

**Step 4: Firewall and Security Software**

- Check if firewall software is blocking BitCraps
- Ensure parental controls aren't restricting the app

**Advanced Solutions:**
