# BitCraps Plugin Architecture Guide

## Overview

The BitCraps plugin system provides a comprehensive architecture for extending the platform with additional casino games. The system is designed with security, performance, and ease of development as core principles.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Plugin Core (`src/plugins/core.rs`)

The core module defines the fundamental plugin architecture:

- **GamePlugin Trait**: The main interface all game plugins must implement
- **PluginManager**: Manages plugin lifecycle and coordination
- **Plugin States**: Tracks plugin status (Uninitialized, Running, Stopped, etc.)
- **Event System**: Handles plugin-to-plugin and system-to-plugin communication

#### Key Features:
- **Type-safe plugin API**: Strongly typed interfaces prevent runtime errors
- **Lifecycle management**: Proper initialization, startup, and shutdown sequences
- **Health monitoring**: Built-in health checks and statistics collection
- **Event-driven architecture**: React to system and game events

### 2. Dynamic Plugin Loader (`src/plugins/loader.rs`)

Handles loading and validation of plugin binaries:

- **Security validation**: Signature verification and metadata validation
- **Dependency resolution**: Handles plugin dependencies automatically
- **Version compatibility**: Ensures API and platform version compatibility
- **Discovery system**: Automatically finds plugins in configured directories

#### Security Features:
- **Plugin signing**: Cryptographic verification of plugin integrity
- **Sandboxed loading**: Isolates plugin loading from main system
- **Capability validation**: Ensures plugins only request necessary permissions

### 3. Plugin Registry (`src/plugins/registry.rs`)

Maintains a catalog of all registered plugins:

- **Metadata management**: Stores plugin information and capabilities
- **Dependency tracking**: Maintains dependency graphs and load order
- **Version management**: Handles plugin updates and compatibility
- **Status tracking**: Monitors plugin registration and loading status

### 4. Sandboxed Execution (`src/plugins/sandbox.rs`)

Provides secure execution environment for plugins:

- **Resource quotas**: Memory, CPU, and network limits per plugin
- **Capability-based security**: Fine-grained permission system
- **Runtime monitoring**: Real-time resource usage tracking
- **Violation detection**: Automatic detection and response to policy violations

#### Security Policies:
- **Memory isolation**: Plugins cannot access each other's memory
- **Network restrictions**: Controlled access to network resources
- **File system limits**: Restricted file system access
- **Execution timeouts**: Prevents infinite loops and hangs

### 5. Communication System (`src/plugins/communication.rs`)

Handles inter-plugin and plugin-system communication:

- **Message passing**: Type-safe message routing between plugins
- **Event broadcasting**: System-wide event distribution
- **Request/response patterns**: Synchronous communication support
- **Message queuing**: Reliable message delivery with buffering

## Plugin Development Guide

### Creating a New Plugin

1. **Implement the GamePlugin trait**:
```rust
#[async_trait]
impl GamePlugin for MyGamePlugin {
    fn get_info(&self) -> PluginInfo { /* ... */ }
    async fn initialize(&mut self, config: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>) -> PluginResult<()> { /* ... */ }
    // ... implement all required methods
}
```

2. **Define plugin metadata**:
```toml
[plugin]
id = "my_game_1_0_0"
name = "My Game"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "A custom casino game"
author = "Your Name"
license = "MIT"
api_version = "1.0"
minimum_platform_version = "1.0.0"
game_type = "Other"
supported_features = ["network", "storage", "crypto"]
```

3. **Handle game actions**:
```rust
async fn process_game_action(
    &mut self,
    session_id: &str,
    player_id: &str,
    action: GameAction,
) -> PluginResult<GameActionResult> {
    match action {
        GameAction::PlaceBet { amount, .. } => {
            // Handle betting logic
        }
        // ... handle other actions
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Always use `PluginResult<T>` for fallible operations
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

2. **State Management**:
   - Use proper synchronization primitives (RwLock, Mutex)
   - Implement state serialization for persistence
   - Handle concurrent access correctly

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Respect resource quotas and limits
   - Clean up resources on shutdown
   - Monitor memory and CPU usage

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Use cryptographically secure random numbers
   - Never trust external data without validation

## Security Model

### Capability-Based Security

Plugins operate under a capability-based security model:

- **NetworkAccess**: Can make network connections
- **DataStorage**: Can store persistent data  
- **Cryptography**: Can use cryptographic functions
- **RealMoneyGaming**: Can process real money transactions
- **InterPluginCommunication**: Can communicate with other plugins

### Resource Quotas

Each plugin operates within strict resource limits:

- **Memory**: Maximum RAM usage (default: 512MB)
- **CPU**: Maximum CPU usage (default: 25%)
- **Network**: Maximum concurrent connections (default: 10)
- **Execution Time**: Maximum operation duration (default: 30s)

### Sandboxing

Plugins run in isolated environments with:

- **Process isolation**: Separate memory spaces
- **File system restrictions**: Limited file access
- **Network filtering**: Controlled network access
- **System call filtering**: Restricted system operations

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Plugins are allocated separate memory pools
- Automatic garbage collection for unused resources
- Memory usage monitoring and alerting
- Configurable memory limits per plugin

### CPU Optimization

- Fair scheduling across all active plugins
- CPU usage monitoring and throttling
- Priority-based execution queues
- Background task management

### Network Efficiency

- Connection pooling for network operations
- Message batching for efficiency
- Bandwidth monitoring and control
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## Monitoring and Observability

### Plugin Health Monitoring

Each plugin provides health information:

```rust
async fn health_check(&self) -> PluginResult<PluginHealth> {
    Ok(PluginHealth {
        state: PluginState::Running,
        memory_usage_mb: 64,
        cpu_usage_percent: 5.0,
        last_heartbeat: SystemTime::now(),
        error_count: 0,
        warnings: vec![],
    })
}
```

### Statistics Collection

Plugins automatically collect statistics:

- Session creation and completion counts
- Action processing rates and latency
- Error rates and types
- Resource usage over time

### Logging Integration

All plugin operations are logged with:

- Structured logging with context
- Configurable log levels per plugin
- Centralized log aggregation
- Performance metrics collection

## Deployment and Distribution

### Plugin Packaging

Plugins are distributed as:

1. **Binary files**: Compiled plugin libraries (.so, .dll, .dylib)
2. **Manifest files**: Metadata and configuration (.toml)
3. **Signature files**: Cryptographic signatures (.sig)
4. **Configuration files**: Default settings (.config.toml)

### Installation Process

1. **Discovery**: Scan plugin directories for new plugins
2. **Validation**: Verify signatures and metadata
3. **Registration**: Add to plugin registry
4. **Loading**: Load into sandbox environment
5. **Initialization**: Configure and start plugin

### Hot Reloading

The system supports hot reloading of plugins:

- **Graceful shutdown**: Existing sessions complete normally
